# Backing up and restoring your AppGini database

It's crucial for any application in production to have a reliable backup and restore mechanism. AppGini applications come with a built-in feature to back up and restore your database.

## Backing up your AppGini database

To back up your AppGini database, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AppGini application as an administrator.
2. Click on the **Admin area** link in the top menu.
3. In the Admin area, open the **Utilities** menu and select **Database backups**.
4. On the Database backups page, click the **Create Backup File** button.

5. A confirmation dialog will appear, informing you that the application will be set to *maintenance mode* during the backup process. Click **OK** to proceed.

      > Usually the backup process takes only a few seconds, but it may take longer for larger databases. During this time, the application will be in maintenance mode, and users will not be able to access it.

6. Once the backup is complete, it will be listed under the **Available backups** section, showing the date, time and size of the backup file.

## Restoring your AppGini database

To restore your AppGini database from a backup file, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your AppGini application as an administrator.
2. Click on the **Admin area** link in the top menu.
3. In the Admin area, open the **Utilities** menu and select **Database backups**.
4. On the Database backups page, find the backup file you want to restore from the **Available backups** section.
5. Click the **Restore** button next to the backup file you want to restore.

6. A confirmation dialog will appear, informing you that the application will be set to *maintenance mode* during the restore process, and that all data in the current database will be **replaced** with the data from the backup file. This includes user accounts, settings, and all data in the database. Click **OK** to proceed.

7. Once the restore is complete, the application will exit maintenance mode, and you will see a success message indicating that the database has been restored successfully.

## Migrating your AppGini application to a new server

If you are migrating your AppGini application to a new server, you can use the backup and restore feature to transfer your database. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Create a backup** of your AppGini database on the old server by following the steps outlined in the "Backing up your AppGini database" section above.
2. **Download the backup file** from the `admin/backups` directory of your AppGini application on the old server. 
     - This file will have a `.sql` extension but would be named as a random string, such as `523f4e5d6b7c8d9e.sql`. 
     - So if you have multiple backups, you can identify the one you want to restore by its date and time. 
     - If you are using an FTP client, like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), you can navigate to the `admin/backups` directory and look for the most recent backup file.
     - If you are accessing the server via command line, you can use list the most recent backup file using the following command (assuming you are in the root directory of your AppGini application):
       ```bash
       ls -lt admin/backups/*.sql | head -n 1
       ```
3. **Upload the backup file** to the `admin/backups` directory of your AppGini application on the new server.

    > Make sure that the web server user has write permissions to this directory. If you are using an FTP client, you can set the permissions to `755` or `775` for the `admin/backups` directory.
4. **Log in to your AppGini application** on the new server as an administrator.
     > You still need to set up the application and database connection settings on the new server before you can log in. But once you restore the database, you can log in to the application using the same credentials as on the old server.
5. **Go to the Admin area** and open the **Utilities** menu, then select **Database backups**.
6. **Find the backup file** you uploaded in the **Available backups** section.
7. Click the **Restore** button next to the backup file you want to restore.
8. Confirm the restore operation in the dialog that appears, and wait for the process to complete.

## Requirements

To use the backup feature, your server must have the `mysqldump` utility installed. This utility is typically included with MySQL installations, so if you have MySQL installed, you likely have `mysqldump` available.

And to be able to restore a backup, your server must have the `mysql` command-line client installed. This is also typically included with MySQL installations.

### Installing MySQL command-line utilities

In some environments, MySQL may be installed on a separate server, and your application server may not have direct access to the MySQL command-line utilities mentioned above. To enable the built-in backup and restore feature to work in such cases, you can install the MySQL command-line utilities on your application server. Assuming you have root access to your server, you can install these utilities using the following commands:

- **For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install mysql-client
  ```
- **For Red Hat/CentOS-based systems:**
  ```bash
  sudo yum install mysql
  ```
- **For Windows systems:**
  Download the MySQL Installer from the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) and select the "MySQL Server" and "MySQL Client" components during installation.
- **For macOS systems:**
  If you have Homebrew installed, you can use the following command:
  ```bash
  brew install mysql
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during backup, check the following:

- Ensure that the `mysqldump` utility is installed and accessible from the command line.
- Make sure the database credentials in your AppGini application have the necessary permissions to perform backups and restores.
- Make sure the web server user has write permissions to the directory where the backup files are stored, which is the `admin/backups` directory inside your AppGini application directory.

    > To change the permissions, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your/appgini/application/admin/backups
    ```

If you're unable to restore a backup, ensure that the backup file is not corrupted and that the `backup` directory is readable by the web server user.
