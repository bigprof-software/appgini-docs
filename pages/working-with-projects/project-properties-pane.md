## localization Settings
### Date/time preview 
This setting controls the format used to display dates within the application. Youcan choose from a predefined list of formats that include the order of day, month,and year, as well as separators like "/" or "-".

### Date order
You can choose the order to display the day, month, and year. Common formats include month/day/year
(e.g., 10/31/2024) or day/month/year (e.g., 31/10/2024).

### Separator
You can specify the character used to separate the day, month, and year parts of a date.
Common choices include slash "/" or hyphen "-".

#### Use 24hr time format
This option determines whether to display time in 24-hour format
(e.g., 14:00) or 12-hour format (e.g., 2:00 PM).


### Character encoding
This setting specifies the character encoding used to store and display text data within the application. Choosing the correct encoding ensures that all characters, including special characters and accented letters, are displayed properly for the target language.

#### Don't enforce MySQL encoding
This option might be related to the database character encoding used to store application data. Enabling it give AppGini more control over the character >encoding used within the application itself.

### Hide the login/membership system
Enabling this option would remove the standard login functionality from the generated web application. This might be useful if you intend to integrate a separate login system or your application doesn't require user accounts.

### Allow admin access to interactive SQL tool
This setting controls access to a built-in tool that allows executing SQL queries directly on the database. Granting access to this tool can be risky, so it's recommended to only enable it for trusted administrators and during development stages.

### Allow admin access to server status page
This option determines whether admins can access a server status page that might display sensitive information about the server environment. Similar to the previous option, it's recommended to disable this for security reasons in production environments.

### Allow admin access to table view SQL
This setting controls whether admins can view the underlying SQL code used to generate table views within the application.  While this might be helpful for debugging purposes, it's not essential for regular application usage and can be disabled for security.

### Change the upload key
This button likely allows you to generate a new secret key used for various purposes within the application, potentially including encryption. It's recommended to keep this key secure as it might be used to tamper with data or unauthorized actions.

### Application URL
This setting allows you to specify the base URL where your generated AppGini application will be accessible after deployment.
