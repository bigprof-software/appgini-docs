# Getting help while you work

In addition to this online help file, there are several additional help resources: there is the continuously expanding [tips and tutorials](/appgini/tips-and-tutorials) section, [AppGini FAQs](/appgini/faqs), the context help inside AppGini, and the [AppGini community forums](http://forums.appgini.com/phpbb/). Context help is a handy tool for obtaining help while you work with your projects without having to be online.

To activate context help, press **`F1`**. This would open the help section at the right side of the AppGini window. This section displays help on whatever element has the focus at the moment. You can use the mouse or the Tab key to move the focus between all the elements of the project window. To hide the help section, press **`F1`** again.

Pressing **`F1`** key opens the help section in the right-side panel. This panel displays context-sensitive help based on the currently focused element.
