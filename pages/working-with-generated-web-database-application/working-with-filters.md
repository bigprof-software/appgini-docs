Filters allow users to have advanced control over data display. The
filters button brings a filters page as shown below.

For example, if we wish to find all customers from France, Germany or
Mexico, whose contact names begin with A, M or P, the filters would look
like this:

If a filter begins with 'And' it means the condition must be
fulfilled, and if it begins with 'Or' then the condition is optional.
You can use % (percentage sign) and \_ (underscore) in comparison values
when the comparison operator is 'Like' or 'Not Like'. % means any
number of characters and \_ means any single character.

There are several comparison operators available for filters, the
following drop-down from the filters page shows them all.

To apply filters to the table view after specifying them, simply click
the \"Apply filters\" button.
